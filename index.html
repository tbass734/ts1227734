        <p>This is my space to practice and explore the art of coding. 
            
            <!---I am very determined to become a master of this trade. I believe in taking advantage of the opportunities offered and learning new skills is the best step for the future. . --->

           <br> Ever since I was a little girl, I have been facsinated by technology. I remember winning a typing contest in 3rd grade. I still remember the pride. But technology and I go way futher than that. My journey began when I was three years old. I got to wrap my tiny fingers around a Super Nitendo. A concole far ahead of it's time. My life was forever changed from that point on. I instantly became obsessed. No other activity seemed to take my interest, and I was against seeking other forms of entertainment. From there my interest in gaming went in a upward trend. I later go on and own a gamecube, ps1, a psp, and an xbox 360.

            But the older I got, the more competing proiorities came my way. I was struggling to find a balance to do the one thing I loved. In school, I was a pretty decent student. I was known to be a teachers pet and getting good grades. The further I progressed, the more work I had to do at home.
